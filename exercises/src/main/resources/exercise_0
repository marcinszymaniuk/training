# get familiar with content of spark-training/data/nasa_http
# define an RDD which reads a from spark-training/data/nasa_http directory
# check if the rdd is correct by calling .take(5)
# try to extract a tuple with ipAddress, timestamp, http method, and url. Don't try to be too precise, if you filter out other informations that would be enough.
# What about some data model? Define simple case class and try to map your rdd to one containing case class instances
#can you make the filtering more precise?
#does your case class define proper types or you are operating on strings? i.e. for timestamps
#are you using anonymous functions? is it readable? if not maybe define some named functions?

#do you have an rdd with logs you are happy about? let's count some things
#how many distinct ipAddresses you have?
#how many distinct http methods?
#can you filter just GET methods?
#If so, can you save your data with gets to a file?
